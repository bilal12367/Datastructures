"""
        This module contains a solution to the candy problem.
        The candy problem is a classic algorithm problem where each child must have at least one candy,
        and children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors. The goal is to determine
        the minimum number of candies needed to distribute to the children based on their ratings.
        Function:
                candy(ratings: List[int]) -> int
                        Determines the minimum number of candies required to distribute to children based on their ratings.
        Args:
                ratings (List[int]): A list of integers representing the ratings of the children.
        Returns:
                int: The minimum number of candies required.
